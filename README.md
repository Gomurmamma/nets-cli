## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Call ‘net-cli game-today’ and receive information on whether there is a game today, if the Nets are home or away, who the opposing team is, and when game time is.
If there is not a game then the tool will give information on when the next upcoming game is along with other information related to the event.

- Using the Commander framework to build cli-tool

<<<<<<< HEAD
Overall this project was a great way to gain experience using NodeJS. Developing the solution from the BallDontLie API was a fun challenge and the light string manipulation has given me greater appreciation for manipulating data.

Additionally, I'd like to return to this project and implement the following:

Develop the following commands
<<<<<<< HEAD
